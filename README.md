Star is a simple 3 page website, but includes many of the most important elements of the HTML language. This assignment is individual, so you cannot collaborate with another student to complete this project.

Your task is to convert the provided text into valid HTML pages. Evaluate the text files and review the screenshots of all three pages. Determine, to the best of your ability how to markup the elements to create a valid HTML document.

At the end of this assignment, you should have three pages linked together by navigation. Take a look at the screen shots and the source text files.

## Getting Started

This activity includes starter files for the three HTML pages, index.html, characters.html, and season_one.html. Download the following source folder and unpack it. In the unzipped folder, you will find the starter files and assets.

This project **_does not_** include solution files.
